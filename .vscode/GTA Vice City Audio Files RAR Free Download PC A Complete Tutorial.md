Some of them are references to pop culture, movies, music, or other games, while others are just funny or bizarre surprises. For example, did you know that you can find a giant chocolate Easter egg inside a building? Or that you can see a ghost ship at night near the lighthouse?

Finally, if you want to improve your skills and abilities in Vice City, you should practice some of the most challenging aspects of the game. One of them is driving slow cars fast, as some missions will require you to do so. For example, one mission will ask you to drive a limousine with a bomb attached to it and keep it above a certain speed limit. To prepare for this, you should try driving slow cars like taxis or vans and get used to their handling and acceleration. Another challenging aspect is flying helicopters and planes, as some missions will involve aerial combat or stunts. To practice this, you should grab a helicopter or a plane whenever you can and fly around the city, avoiding obstacles and enemies. You can also try some of the side missions that involve flying, such as the RC Baron Race or the Checkpoint Charlie.[^3^]
